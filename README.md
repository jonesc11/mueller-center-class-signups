# Mueller Center Class Sign-ups

The focus of this project is to streamline the process of signing up for classes through the Mueller Center. As it stands now, the Mueller Center has a generally disorganized and paper-based system that could be greatly improved upon. Our solution would provide mechanisms for people to sign up for classes online, for instructors to email out the members in their classes directly, and for administrators to add and update classes and payment statuses. The ultimate goal is for this project to eventually be turned over to the Mueller Center for integration. More details are provided in the writeup located in the documents folder of this repository.
