# Mueller Center Class Sign-ups

The focus of this project is to streamline the process of signing up for classes through the Mueller Center. As it stands now, the Mueller Center has a generally disorganized and paper-based system that could be greatly improved upon. Our project would allow 
interested parties to sign up for classes and events online, as well as providing the instructors with an easy way to contact the members of their class. Depending on the viability, we may also extend this to include bursar and credit card payment support.
